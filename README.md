DepthView
=========
is a viewer for stereoscopic 3D .jps and .pns images and also some formats of 3D video. I run it on Windows, Linux, and Android.

This is a WIP complete rewrite using QML and OpenGL. The original project is located here: [DepthView]

Supported Draw Modes
--------------------
* Red/Cyan Anglaph
* Side by Side (with mirror)
* Top/Bottom (also with mirror)
* Interlaced (horizontal and vertical)
* Checkerboard
* Single Image (Mono)

I am also working on a VR plugin, but I have no ETA on it.

Dependencies
